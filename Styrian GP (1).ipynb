    "From the above results, Sector 2 has consistently been the most correlated sector with finishing position. There has been quite a lot of variation in the correlation with Sector 1. A possible explanation is the importance of straight line speed in a given year. Sector 1 consists of two straights, with no difficult turns or hairpins. It is possible that, when the cars have varying performance in straight-line speed, this sector becomes more important in relation to finishing position. Additionally, it is the quickest sector, which could introduce more noise into the lap times. \n",
